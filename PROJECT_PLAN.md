# Guitar Chord Fingering Generator - Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project creates two complementary tools for guitar chord diagram generation:

1. **Chord-to-Fingerings Tool**: Given a chord name (e.g., "Cmaj7/E"), generate all valid guitar fingerings
2. **Fingering-to-Diagram Tool**: Given a fingering specification, generate a visual fretboard diagram

### Target Audience
- Beginner to intermediate guitar players
- Musicians learning chord theory and fretboard navigation
- Anyone needing practical, theoretically-sound chord fingerings

### Guitar Specifications
- Standard 6-string guitar
- 22 frets
- Standard tuning: E-A-D-G-B-E (low to high)
- Focus on playable, ergonomic fingerings

### Supported Chord Types
- Major, minor, diminished, augmented
- Extensions: 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th
- Alterations: add, sus, altered dominants
- Slash chords (particularly important for fingerstyle playing)
- Complex notation: "Cmaj7", "F#m7b5", "Dm7/G", etc.

## Design Approach: Rule-Based Musical Theory

### Why This Approach?
After evaluating multiple implementation patterns, we chose the rule-based musical theory approach because:

- **Theoretically Sound**: Generates fingerings based on actual music theory
- **Practical for Target Users**: Focuses on commonly-used, learnable patterns
- **Extensible**: Can handle complex chord types algorithmically
- **Reliable**: Produces consistent, predictable results

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Database Approach**: Pre-curated fingerings (limited scope, maintenance overhead)
2. **Algorithmic Search**: Brute-force generation (computationally expensive, impractical results)
3. **Hybrid System**: Templates + algorithms (complex architecture)
4. **Position-Aware**: Multiple subsystems per fretboard region (maintenance complexity)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Chord Symbol Parser
**Purpose**: Convert chord names into structured musical data
**Input**: "Cmaj7/E", "F#m7b5", "Dm7add9"
**Output**: `{root: Note, quality: str, extensions: [int], bass: Note?}`
**Features**:
- Handle notation variations ("Cmaj7" = "CM7" = "C△7")
- Parse slash chord notation
- Validate input and provide helpful error messages
- Support enharmonic equivalents (F# = Gb)

#### 2. Music Theory Engine
**Purpose**: Convert chord symbols to sets of required notes
**Features**:
- Apply interval patterns (maj7 = [1, 3, 5, 7])
- Handle chord extensions and alterations
- Manage voice leading preferences
- Account for guitar's polyphonic limitations

#### 3. Fretboard Mapping System
**Purpose**: Model the guitar neck and map notes to positions
**Features**:
- String/fret coordinate system
- Note-to-position mapping across all strings
- Open string handling
- Fret range management (0-22 frets)

#### 4. Fingering Generation Engine
**Purpose**: Create playable fingerings that contain required chord tones
**Features**:
- Generate candidate fingerings algorithmically
- Apply ergonomic constraints (finger stretch, hand position)
- Prioritize common positions (open chords, barre patterns)
- Handle optional notes and doubling preferences

#### 5. Fingering Ranking & Filtering System
**Purpose**: Select and order the best fingerings
**Criteria**:
- Playability (hand span, finger independence)
- Commonality (frequently-used patterns)
- Musical quality (voice leading, bass note prominence)
- Difficulty level (beginner-friendly prioritization)

### Data Structures

```python
# Core data representations
class Note:
    """Pitch class with enharmonic awareness"""
    pitch_class: int  # 0-11 (C=0, C#=1, etc.)
    name: str         # "C", "F#", "Bb"

class Chord:
    """Structured chord representation"""
    root: Note
    quality: str           # "maj", "min", "dim", "aug"
    extensions: List[int]  # [7, 9, 11, 13]
    alterations: Dict[int, str]  # {5: "b", 9: "#"}
    bass: Optional[Note]   # For slash chords

class Fingering:
    """Guitar fingering representation"""
    positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]  # [(string, fret), ...]
    fingers: List[int]                # [0=open, 1-4=fingers, -1=muted]
    muted_strings: List[int]          # [1, 6] for muted strings
    difficulty: float                 # 0.0-1.0 difficulty score
```
